# Stroke_Prediction-
Stroke is a medical disorder in which the blood arteries in the brain are ruptured, causing damage to the brain. When the supply of blood and other nutrients to the brain is interrupted, symptoms might develop. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the greatest cause of death and disability globally. Early recognition of the various warning signs of a stroke can help reduce the severity of the stroke.  We have built a Machine Learning Model using Random Forest Classifier to detect the same.
